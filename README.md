# YAMP (Yet Another Meeting Planner)
This is a private project created with the sole purpose of learning.

**Yamp** is a meeting planner. It gives the user the possibility to plan a meeting (describe the purpose of the meeting and the possible dates when it may take place) and to poll the interested parties on what are the best dates the meeting can take place. Each invitee will receive an email, in which he/she can vote for the dates on which he/she can attend the meeting.

An user has the possibility to register and in this way he will have access to the history of all his meetings.

This is the UI of YAMP. It is created with React using Create React Application.
